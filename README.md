# Improper-Integrals

The Example files demonstrating various calculation related to intergrals considered in the following work

[Closed Form Expressions for Certain Improper Integrals of Mathematical Physics](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.13436).

They contain the evaluation of the Melling-Barnes representation and also the evaluation of analytic continuation. 
*MbConicHull.wl* , *MultivariateResidues.m* , *Olsson.wl* and *ROC2.wl* are the packages that are required to run these files.

**Example files**

Example file *Ising.nb* contains the evaluation of various Ising integrals considered in the paper. 

Example file *Box.nb* contains the evaluation of Box integrals considered in the paper.
